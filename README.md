# samp-stdlib

The San Andreas Multiplayer Pawn Standard Library Package as a wrapper for those provided in open.mp
Designed for the [sampctl package management system](http://sampctl.com).

## Why?

The package management system built into the `sampctl` tool is based on GitHub (similar to that of
the Go language) so it simplifies the process to have the standard library stored here on GitHub
too.  This means there doesn't need to be any special-case code written for the standard library, it
can just be a package like all others.
